   <p>CHICAGO (CBS) -- Authorities said 22-year-old Robert "Bobby" E. Crimo III, the "person of interest" in the deadly Highland Park July 4th mass shooting is now in police custody. Highland Park mayor Nancy Rotering said charges are likely to be filed later Tuesday.

The high-powered rife used in the shooting was purchased legally, the mayor said. Crimo fired more than 70 rounds during the assault, authorities said. 

He was spotted in North Chicago, police attempted traffic stop, he fled, then they stopped him in Lake Forest, and was taken into custody without incident.

The holiday mass shooting left six dead and dozens injured. Police said the shooting happened around 10:15 a.m. during the July 4th parade. Authorities said the gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop using a high-powered rifle.
